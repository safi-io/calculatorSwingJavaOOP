# **Calculator GUI**  
### **OOP Assignment 4**  

This project is a GUI-based scientific calculator developed in Java using the Swing framework. It is designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts, such as modularization, event-driven programming, and file handling.

---

## **Features**  
- **Basic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
- **Scientific Functions**: Trigonometric operations (SIN, COS, TAN) and usage of Ï€.  
- **Display Label**: Shows real-time input and results.  
- **History Menu**:  
  - **View History**: Displays past calculations in a scrollable window.  
  - **Delete History**: Clears the saved calculation history.  
- **Persistent Storage**: Saves and retrieves calculation history from a text file.  

---

## **How to Run**  
1. Ensure you have **Java JDK 8 or later** installed.  
2. Add the `exp4j` library to your project for expression evaluation.  
3. Compile and run the program in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).  
4. The GUI calculator window will appear, allowing you to perform operations.

## **File Structure**
The project is divided into the following files:  
- **Calculator.java**: Main class to initialize the GUI and layout.  
- **MenuBar.java**: Handles the creation of the menu bar and its actions.  
- **DisplayLabel.java**: Manages the display label for inputs and outputs.  
- **Buttons.java**: Generates buttons dynamically and assigns actions.  
- **History.java**: Displays the calculation history in a new window.  
- **FileHandling.java**: Handles saving, reading, and deleting calculation history.

## **Core Concepts Demonstrated**
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Separation of concerns into multiple classes.  
- **Event Handling**: Button click actions and menu item listeners.  
- **File I/O**: Reading and writing history to a text file.  
- **Layout Management**: Using `GridBagLayout` for flexible GUI design.
